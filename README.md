## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For the filtering part of the project, as I added the listing divs dinamically through the json file, I also added classes to each div corresponding to the roles, level, languages and tools. Later, those were accessed to display only the pertinent listings whenever any filter or filters are selected. Feedback is welcome!
